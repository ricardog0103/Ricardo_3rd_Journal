The essence of human / higher level learning is developing the skill to discriminate patterns and identify shared characteristics across events (stimuli).
Memorization - the regurgitation of facts - is considered the lowest level of learning.
Why, then, are students encouraged to learn CS?
What should students learn from CS?

-I think students are encouraged to learn CS because it is good to exercise the brain and its
	problem solving process. Problem solving skills and the ablilty to troubleshoot are great
	powers in today's world with all the technology around us. In this class we are encouraged to
	"tinker", to try new things and go based of your brain to see if something will work or not
	and if it doesn't that is when you troubleshoot and try to solve the problem. Of course students
	learn to code, and articulate what they learn from project to project and even learn on their 
	own.
-I believe students should learn, like i said before, to code and be good at the code, not like
	and elite hexor that answers the worlds problems on stack overflow, but be good enough to help
	out others and beginners. With all the technology around us it should not be hard to learn to 
	code and further your ablility to learn CS like topics like OOP.
