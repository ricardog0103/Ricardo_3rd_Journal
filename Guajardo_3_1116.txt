No, really, How will you use methods in your game? Why?
I will use methods to creat a timer of how long the user has to pick a 
descision and also i will have a inglesh and spanish version of the game.

What values will you pass to them
I wiill past booleans and maybe integers but mostly booleans for the most part.
