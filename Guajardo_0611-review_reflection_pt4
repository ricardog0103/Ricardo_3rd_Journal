    Explain in your own words -- what happens with nested for loops?
    E.g.,

            for (int i = 0; i <= board[0].length - 1; i++) {
                        for (int j = 0; j <= board[1].length - 1; j++) { ....}
          

	What this nest for loop is doing is that is going/cointing through a 2D grid like the one we 
in our game. This code is in the code you gave use in that journal to use to make a grid in our game.
This is the code:

		for (int i = 0; i <= map[0].length - 1; i++) {
            		for (int j = 0; j <= map[1].length - 1; j++) {

	An example of what this pice of code can do is that you got a for loopm that cou8nt maybe to 
20The first for loopin the code run trough what ever its inside of it for exapmle '.' ,then the second 
for loop run 20 times again.The for loop repeats this process 19 time until it reaches 20. The total
time is would run would be 200 i believe.
