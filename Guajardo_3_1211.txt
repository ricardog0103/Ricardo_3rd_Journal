During / after the holiday, we will be constructing "dungeon crawlers" (or side-scrollers).

Describe the 2-D dungeon or world you would like to have for your game.

Why?

I would like to have a world like the movie The Hobbit or The lord Of The Ring.
I would like to have a worls like this because it looks cool to live like 
that. Fighting dragons,goblins =, othe crazy creaturesThe opions are endless.
