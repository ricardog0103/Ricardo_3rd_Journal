-I did everything i could to finish my game on time, but unable complete the task.But unable to work on it at home because my computer has not been workin for a while i could
not work on my map over the brake.Thus slowing me down and not being able to finish on time even though i tride to come every day after school or in the morning 
when possible. If i didnt have thsi problwem i would of probaly had a better finish product and even finish on time.
