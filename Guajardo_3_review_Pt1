Create the class, an object, and class constructor for class student

	public class Student{
	int height;
	int shoeSize;
	String ethnecity;
	String haircolor;

	public Student(int r, int i, String c, String a){
		this.height - r;
		this.shoeSize = i;
		this.ethneciy = c;
		this.hairColor = a;
	}
}

Describe - if we were to continue with Arduino - what would you create?
	If we were to countinue to work with Aurduino i would like to add to my alarm clock 
a little tune to play when the alarm goes off, and a patter of led's to go off with it as well.
I guess it i were to finish that project i would like to create a ganme of conect four.It seem 
like a good challage to do and it seems pretty cool. I would like it to play a tune with the 
buzzer when the winner wins.
