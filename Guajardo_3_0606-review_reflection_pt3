    Given mymap[67][43] Which is the x coordinate? Which is the y coordinate? Why? How does this happen?
    Consider:
	The coordinate for 'x' is 43 and for 'y' it is 67. It works like this because for some reson i 2D array it work diffrent compare to your regual algebra coordinates.

            for (int i = 0; i <= map[0].length - 1; i++) {
                for (int j = 0; j <= map[1].length - 1; j++) {
                    if (j < map[1].length - 1) {
                      if (i=0){ System.out.print("8888"); #a
                        } else if (map[i][j] != 'x') {
                            System.out.print("."); #e
                        } else {
                            System.out.print(map[i][j]); #b
                        }
                    } else {
                        if (map[i][j] != 'x') {
                            System.out.println("."); #c
                        } else {
                            System.out.println(map[i][j]); #d
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
            
            
          

    Write the code from line #a and explain what it does.
	if (i = 0){ System.out.print("8888");
       -The beginning of the line would be 8888 (i is x) in this case of the code you can see that after 'a'
    Write the code from line #b and explain what it does.
	System.out.print(map[i][j]); #b
	This prints out whatever is 'x' on the map/grid.So if its like an '@' it will pring a '@'.
    Write the code from line #c and explain what it does. Explain how its different than #e
	System.out.println("."); #c
	-#e print the array that is going to be printed in your game. #c print the specifixc coordinate for example [23][16].
    Write the code from line #d and explain what it does.
	System.out.println(map[i][j]); #d
	-This line of code print out the player when there at the edge of tbhe map/grid.

    Explain how to use a boolean with a while loop. Provide a very specific use case and code example.
	-You can have a boolean called like runGame , in your main or game, Which will keep running and keep it as true, but once the enmy hits lets say a trap or enemy 
	you can make it false and it can end the game or whjene ever you want to end the game you would use false 
    Explain the use of static.
	A  static class make your objects or what ever it is have the same value across your whole game, so if u change it all of the same objects change as well.For example if you have
	multiple enemys	and one dies they all die.
    Provide an example of how you could use an object with your game. Give a code example.
	A gtrat way to implement a objects is for enemys you implement it makes it easier and you would be able to have multiples of the as well as traps.
