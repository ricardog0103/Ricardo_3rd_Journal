A method is a mini program that you will use over and over again in your program.
There are usefull because they save you a lot of time. Because instead of writting that pice of code every time you want to use it,you will only write it ones.
To find prime numbers you will use this code;

int x = 0;
        for(int i=2; i<102 ; i ++){
            System.out.println(i);
            if(i % 2 == 0){
            x++;
        }
            System.out.println("There are " + x + " even numbers.");
        }
