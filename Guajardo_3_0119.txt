What slick game did you create?
-I created a dungen game where you have to find four special dimonds but thre
are 6 diffrent enemies trying to kill you.

What challenges did you solve
-I found how to put the enemies in diffrent location and whem youre in a surten
perimeter they will actiuvate and follow you.
Before the Winter break, you were admonished to finish your maps and spritesheets - so that you would be ready to go with the game when we got back. Did you? Why or why not?
Were you able to meet the timeline? Why or why not? [Focus on what you did or did not do. Journals ascribing blame to others will not be considered.
-I dint finish on time. Because i didnt have access to any computer at home 
because my pc has not been working for a while now.This has been hold me back
a good amount of time.
