    In the Array Game assignment you have had to review and revisit concepts you may have forgotten about. These will all be tested on the final exam!
    What is an array?
	-There a list of data types.
    How does one make a simple array of Strings?
	-String[]
    What is the syntax for a 2-D array?
	-datatype[]
    What is the syntax for a 3-D array?
	-datatype[][]
    How does one change the value for the third value in a one dimensional array? [Give specific code]
	-Dog[5] = 0;
    What is the syntax for a while loop?
	while (run == true ){
	
	}
    Why use while loops in your game?
	-I will use while loopes in my game to end the game whne the person wins or when the person loses.

    Your game should be in a method outside of main --- How will you call your game in main?
	game()
    Why was it recommended that you use .toLowerCase() with your Scanner input?
	-so it wouldn't matter what case the user's input was when the game asked for an input, and you could just check for 1 or 2 things you need to check.
    You should use different methods when moving the protagonist and to check for intersections. How? Why?
	-Just have a method that returns a boolean for example and intersect check or for  an int to check the diffent types of intersection uin the grid.
	you would need to do this because other wise it would be cluttered to type it over and over again, and you would need to run/call it often.
    What values will you pass across methods? how? why?
	-The int the player put in when ask for numbers.
