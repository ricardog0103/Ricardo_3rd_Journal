    The Slick assignment was intended to gently familiarize you with 2-D arrays. Some students recognized the 2-D arrays from Slick and
        previous journals --- other students had no recollection. Which were you? Why? Note - attributing the environment is not pragmatic
        - as students experienced the same environment (though they might have experienced it differently)
         -At first when i saw what in had to see i  didnt see the connection with the slick assigment we did. But when i started working on it is saw the simuilarities.
        The way we added the player,enemy,traps ect. Also the way i added traps by using math.reandom. Then i notice if i really wanted to i could add health, and
        inventorty to the layer and enemyes.
